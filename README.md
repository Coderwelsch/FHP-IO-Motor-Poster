# Motor Fader
In the last project of the Input / Output course of the FH Potsdam we had to build an animated wallpaper / picture with the use of Arduino Boards in the *#IoT* style.

At first, my idea was to animate an analogue wallpaper in relation to a very old basic school education film about the behavior in the case of a nuclear disaster. In fact that i am a fan of South Park I chose a south park styled wallpaper. This is a small extract of the educational film:

And this is my first mockup (video):

After the second consultation with the prof i decided to rethink about my last mockup and do something more interesting.

So my second idea was to create a parallax wallpaper. A wallpaper splitted into 3 different layers overlapping each other and moving relatively to the viewers head to gain a 3D looking wallpaper.

In the next step I built the case for the wallpaper:
