<h1>Motor Fader</h1>

<p>In the last project of the Input / Output course of the FH Potsdam we had to build an animated wallpaper / picture with the use of Arduino Boards in the <em>#IoT</em> style.</p>

<h2>Version 1</h2>

<p>At first, my idea was to animate an analogue wallpaper in relation to a very old basic school education film about the behavior in the case of a nuclear disaster. In fact that I am a fan of South Park I chose a south park styled wallpaper. This is a small extract of the educational film:</p>

<p>And this is my first mockup (video):

<p>After the second consultation with the prof I decided to rethink about my last mockup and do something more interesting.</p>

<h2>Version 2</h2>

<p>So my second idea was to create a parallax wallpaper. A wallpaper splitted into 3 different layers overlapping each other and moving relatively to the viewers head to gain a 3D looking wallpaper.</p>

<p>In the next step I built the case for the wallpaper:
